Optimization techniques for smooth performance:

Hardware Acceleration: To optimize animations, use CSS properties that trigger hardware acceleration, such as transform and opacity. These properties allow the browser to use hardware acceleration to handle the animations, resulting in smoother performance.
Use will-change: You can use the will-change CSS property to hint to the browser that an element will be animated, allowing it to perform optimizations in advance.
Use Transitions: For simpler animations, consider using CSS transitions instead of JavaScript. Transitions are hardware-accelerated and often perform better for basic animations like fading, scaling, and opacity changes.

By employing these optimization techniques, you can create smooth and efficient animations that enhance the user experience without causing performance issues.
